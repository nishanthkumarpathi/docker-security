### Lab Exercise

In this scenario you'll learn how to configure User Namespaces to add additional user isolation and remap container root users to non-privileged users on the host machine.

Step 1 - Identify current Docker user

ps aux | grep docker

Step 2 - Download the alpine image and check the id

docker run --rm alpine id

Step 3 - create a copy of the touch command on our host.

sudo cp /bin/touch /bin/touch.bak && ls -lha /bin/touch.bak

Step 4 - Because the container is both root inside the container and on the host, the file can be removed.

docker run -it -v /bin/:/host/ alpine rm -f /host/touch.bak

Step 5 - As a result, the command no longer exists.

ls -lha /bin/touch.bak
