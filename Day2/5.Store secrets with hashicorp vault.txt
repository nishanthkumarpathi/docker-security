Start-vault.sh script will launch the Consul and Vault containers

Command 1

	./start-vault.sh

The Vault starts sealed ( meaning you can't read/write data )

Command 2

	./unseal-vault.sh

Now if you do directory listing , you will see a new file called keys.txt

Command 3

  ls

The final stage is to obtain the access token; this is outputted when we initialised and unsealed the vault.

Command 4

  export VAULT_TOKEN=$(grep 'Initial Root Token:' keys.txt | awk '{print substr($NF, 1, length($NF)-1)}')

By logging in we can now start storing and persisting data

Command 5

	vault auth -address=${VAULT_ADDR} ${VAULT_TOKEN}

After running the commands Vault and your environment have been configured.

Run the following command to write data into the Vault.

Command 6

	vault write -address=${VAULT_ADDR} secret/app-1/db-password value=mysecretpassword

  The name of the key is db-password which we're storing under the collection app-1.

Command 7

  nohup docker-volume-libsecret --addr $VAULT_ADDR --backend vault --store-opt token=$VAULT_TOKEN </dev/null &> libsecretlogs &

Command 8

  docker run -ti --rm --volume-driver libsecret -v secret/app-1/:/secrets alpine ash

Command 9

  cat secrets/db-password

Command 10

  echo 'Will this be stored?' > secrets/db-password

Command 11

	ls /secrets
